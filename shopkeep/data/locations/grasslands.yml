name: grasslands
description: the prairie right outside of town
flavor1: The winds whip the tall grasses outside of town into a frenzy.
flavor2: You can hear naught but bug announcing their presence in the nearby grass.
flavor3: The path through the grass seems almost iddylic as the stalks waver in the
  wind.
